# ImageSplit

This Python script is built specifically for parsing character sheets generated in Stable Diffusion, based on my blog post on the topic and using the posted template sheets: 
https://cobaltexplorer.com/2023/06/character-sheets-for-stable-diffusion/

The script can be called from the command line with:

python ImageSplit.py -f [filename] -d [destination directory]

filename: should be the output file from Stable Diffusion

destination directory: The directory to save the output images
